# Practice NLP with Bags of Popcorn dataset

![][headline_img]

## Introduction

This repository is a hands-on implementation for the IMDB movie review sentimental analysis.
The part of tutorial section is following [Bags of Popcorn kaggle competition].
It's provided a step-by-step improvement leveraging different NLP techniques with the same dataset.
I've extended the tutorial based on my interest such as adding Deep learning model, or Multiple input features.

## Learning objectives

- Familiar with the tools
    - nltk
    - gensim
    - keras
    
- Learn the processeses
    - Data cleansing (Remove, Filtering, Tokenizing, Lemmatization, Padding, etc.)
    - Feature prrocessing (BOW, TFIDF, Feature engieering, Word Embbedding)
    - Input structure required by different models (Tabular, Sequences, Multi-input)
    - Model structure (Tree-based model, Deel learning, Recurrent NN, etc.)

- Applied to others
    - Binary classification (sentimental analysis)
    - Multi-class classification (types of review)
    - Regression (polarization score)
    - Applied text features with other kinds of problem (propensity, churn, etc.)

## Roadmap

- Try more feature engieering techniques from text data
    - Part of speech
    - Verbal and grammatical
    - Uni | Bi | Tri gram
    - LDA clustering

- Applied to other problems

    - [Natural language Processing with diaster tweets]
    - [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification]
